%Mean Interannual Difference Adjusted for Skewness (MIDAS) Robust Trend Estimator 

% MIDAS calculates the slope for all pairs of GPS daily position
% observations separated by one year, For each station. Slopes that are
% more than two standard deviations away from the median are removed,
% assuming that the majority of data will fit a normal distribution. The
% output is the median of all the slopes calculated for each station, as
% well as the standard deviation for that station.

% INPUTS: 
% pos is a matrix of all positions for each day, for each station.
% Each row should be a new station, each column is the position on each day.
% 
% time is a matrix of the day corresponding to each correpsonding position
% in pos. Each row is a new station, each column is the day written in
% serial date number form (i.e. the number of days sincs 01-00-0000)
